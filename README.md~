Project Part 1
==============

Team members:

- Kieran Hannigan - 21151118
- Thomas Frazer Eagle Drake-Brockman - 21150739

The project was written and tested on
GNU/Linux Fedora and Ubuntu. The Windows
libraries were removed to keep version
control clean, but if Windows is used for
marking and libraries are all configured,
the makefile should be fairly agnostic.

Game mode is the individual additional 
functionality implemented by Kieran.

Thomas' individual contributions are
object selection, object duplication,
the ability to hide and unhide objects.

The additions included in vsync and 
full screen modes, along with character
jumping, and alpha transparency are 
examples of implementation of additional
functionality by the team.
